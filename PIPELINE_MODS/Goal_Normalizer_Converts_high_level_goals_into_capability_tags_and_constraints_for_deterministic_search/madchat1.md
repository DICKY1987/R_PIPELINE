Manifest-Driven, Standards-Anchored, Guard-railed Pipeline

One-liner: Keep a single source of truth (pipeline.yml) that declares modules, order, dependencies, and loop rules; generate your diagrams/docs from it; enforce a Two-ID naming scheme for every module file with an automated “nameguard”; validate everything in CI so docs and code never drift.

1) Use the right standards in the right places

Flow (control logic): BPMN 2.0 (or UML Activity if your team is more dev-centric). Autogenerate a Mermaid view for PRs.

Structure (static architecture): C4 (Context → Containers → Components) so reviewers see where modules live.

Per-module docs shape: Diátaxis (Tutorial, How-to, Reference, Explanation) so every module reads the same.

Spec inspiration: CWL ideas for step/tool I/O contracts (even if you don’t run CWL).

2) Treat a versioned manifest as source of truth

manifests/pipeline.yml: lists your modules, dependencies, loop/parallelism, and failure policy.

manifests/schema.json: JSON Schema to lint the manifest.

Auto-render: Mermaid (always in the repo), optional BPMN for formal diagrams; fail the PR if the rendered diagram isn’t in sync.

3) Make modules self-describing and machine-checkable

Per module (minimal, repeatable set):

{TID}.run.py (headless entry), {TID}.config.yaml, {TID}.schema.*.json, {TID}.example.*.json, plus role files (e.g., {TID}.rules.yaml, {TID}.scoring.py).

A stable api.py export (generated) so imports never change when filenames are auto-renamed.

4) Enforce a Two-ID naming convention with automation

Two-ID: mnemonic (2 letters from module key) + short hash shard (e.g., DR-5K9).

Filename pattern: {TID}.{role}[.{name}].{ext} (e.g., DR-5K9.run.py, DR-5K9.rules.yaml).

Nameguard: a tiny checker/renamer that:

reads /PIPELINE_MODS/registry.yaml (module → mnemonic/hash/color),

prefixes files, validates headers, (re)generates api.py,

runs on pre-commit (--fix for local) and in CI (--check only).

5) Build in phases (maps to your folders)

Phase 0 – Backplane: Ledger, Policy Pack, Caching/Rate-Limiter, Concurrency Controller, Observability.

Phase 1 – Intake & Routing: Plan Ingestor → Work-Stream Planner → Domain Router → Goal Normalizer → Query Expander.

Phase 2 – Discovery & Scoring: Discovery Adapters → Feature Extractors → Scorer.

Phase 3 – Synthesis & Patch: Synthesizer → Structured Patcher.

Phase 4 – Quality Gates (loop): Guardrails → Verifier → Error Auto-Repair (one loop max).

Phase 5 – Decision & Export: Selector → Exporter → Provenance/Rollback Manager.

Phase 6 – Knowledge & CI Glue: Knowledge Reuse Manager → Playbook Promoter → CI/Pre-Commit Integrator.

(Work-Stream Planner controls fan-out; Concurrency Controller caps parallel jobs; Ledger and Observability run across all phases.)

6) Docs-as-code and anti-rot gates

Autogenerate Mermaid/BPMN and C4 views on every PR.

CI checks:

Manifest validates against schema.

Diagram + docs re-rendered and committed.

Every modules[].key has a docs folder (Diátaxis skeleton present).

Nameguard passes (Two-ID clean).

Optional: smoke-verify each module’s example.* with {TID}.run.py --in/--out.

7) Provenance & lineage (optional but recommended)

Record job/runs/inputs/outputs (OpenLineage-style). Keys mirror module keys & Two-IDs so design ↔ execution aligns.

8) Your immediate next steps (lowest effort, highest leverage)

Create manifests/pipeline.yml + schema.json (start with top-level phases and your module keys only).

Create /PIPELINE_MODS/registry.yaml with mnemonics for each of your listed module folders.

Add nameguard + pre-commit hooks; run once to normalize file names and generate api.py shims.

Add a docs skeleton:

/docs/pipeline/overview.md (links to rendered Mermaid+BPMN),

/docs/modules/<key>/README.md (Diátaxis placeholders).

Wire a minimal Mermaid generator from the manifest; commit the generated .mmd into /diagrams.

Add CI jobs: schema-lint manifest, run nameguard --check, regenerate diagrams/docs, and fail on drift.

Implement the backplane trio first: Ledger, Policy Pack, Caching/Rate-Limiter (unlocks reproducible runs).

Implement Plan Ingestor → Work-Stream Planner → Domain Router as a thin vertical slice; prove fan-out works.

Why this works for your project

It matches your deterministic, audit-first ethos (Two-ID + ledger + schema).

It scales (planner + concurrency caps + per-module contracts).

It prevents drift (generated diagrams + CI gates).

It keeps humans optional (headless runners; GUI can be added later as a control surface).

If you follow this, you’ll have a pipeline that is legible to humans (BPMN/C4/Diátaxis), reliable for machines (manifest/schema/Two-ID), and resistant to entropy (nameguard + CI).
