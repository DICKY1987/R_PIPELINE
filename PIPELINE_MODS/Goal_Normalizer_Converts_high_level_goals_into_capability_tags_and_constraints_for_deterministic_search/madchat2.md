Absolutely—PowerShell has strong, “proven” equivalents across all those areas. Here’s a tight, pick-and-use shortlist mapped to your Python list:

Task runners & automation

Invoke-Build – PowerShell-native task runner with targets, dependencies, parallelism, and incremental builds (Make-/Rake-style). Great backbone for local automation and CI. 
GitHub

psake – Rake-inspired build tool in pure PowerShell; simple Invoke-psake tasks for build/test/package flows.

File watching & continuous runs

.NET FileSystemWatcher (+ Register-ObjectEvent) – Built-in, cross-platform file watcher you script directly in PowerShell; the standard way to trigger “on-save” actions. (Be mindful of partial writes/locking; debounce/retry.) 
PowerShell One

PowerShellGuard – “Guard”-style watcher that re-runs Pester tests when files change; dead-simple TDD loop. 
GitHub

PestWatch – Minimal watcher that calls Invoke-Pester on change.

Watch-Command (PSGallery) / pswatch – Lightweight “rerun a command when files change” utilities.

Test orchestration & quality gates

Pester – The PowerShell test framework (BDD style), integrates cleanly with CI; supports proper exit codes and NUnit XML for reports.

PSScriptAnalyzer – Static analysis/linting for PowerShell; use in CI and pre-commit.

Subprocess & remote execution

PowerShell Remoting (WinRM/SSH) – Invoke-Command, Enter-PSSession; run tasks locally or across many machines; works over SSH in modern PS.

ThreadJob / Start-Job – Concurrency primitives for parallel task fans; ThreadJob is a lighter, in-process option.

Posh-SSH – Mature SSH/SFTP/SCP module for remote automation where native remoting isn’t available.

Templates & “proven” project scaffolds

Plaster – The go-to project scaffolder for modules/scripts (think Cookiecutter for PowerShell).

PSModuleDevelopment – Templating + build/test/deploy helpers for module projects; batteries included. 
PSFramework

ModuleBuild / ModuleBuilder – Scaffolding & build pipelines (often layered on Invoke-Build + Plaster).

Pre-commit gating (to enforce your “research-first” rule, lint, tests)

pre-commit (framework) can run pwsh hooks to execute PSScriptAnalyzer and Pester before every commit; or use native Git hooks that call PowerShell.

A practical starter stack (mirrors your Python flow)

Invoke-Build drives tasks (Format, Lint, Test, Package). 
GitHub

PowerShellGuard (or FileSystemWatcher) triggers Invoke-Pester on save for tight TDD.

PSScriptAnalyzer + Pester run in pre-commit (or .git/hooks/pre-commit) to block low-quality commits.

ThreadJob parallelizes heavier subtasks; Posh-SSH handles remote steps.

Plaster / PSModuleDevelopment standardize repo scaffolding so every project looks and behaves the same
