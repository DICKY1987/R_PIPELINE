Blueprint: Hybrid Git Safety & Synchronization System
Architecture Specification for Agentic Implementation
Version: 1.0
Purpose: Unified specification combining bidirectional sync with AI tool safety
Target Implementer: Agentic AI Code Generator
Output: Complete, production-ready Git automation system

I. SYSTEM OVERVIEW
A. Core Objectives

Prevent work loss from any source (tool crashes, terminal closures, system failures)
Enable parallel tool execution without conflicts or blocking
Maintain bidirectional synchronization with remote repository
Avoid infinite CI/CD loops through multiple prevention layers
Provide comprehensive recovery mechanisms for all failure modes
Minimize manual intervention through full automation

B. Architectural Principles

Defense in depth: Multiple overlapping safety mechanisms
Fail-safe defaults: Every operation preserves data
Explicit coordination: Clear boundaries between components
Observable operations: All actions leave audit trails
Idempotent by design: Safe to retry any operation
Platform-aware: Adapt to Windows vs Unix differences


II. COMPONENT ARCHITECTURE
A. System Layers (Bottom to Top)
Layer 5: User Interface (shell aliases, wrappers)
         ↓
Layer 4: Session Management (tool invocation wrappers)
         ↓
Layer 3: Workspace Isolation (Git worktrees)
         ↓
Layer 2: Synchronization Engine (bidirectional sync)
         ↓
Layer 1: Git Safety Foundation (hooks, locks, configuration)
B. Component Interaction Model
Synchronization Domain:

Polling Loop → Lock Manager → Git Operations → Remote Push/Pull
File Watcher → Debouncer → Lock Manager → Git Operations

Tool Session Domain:

Tool Wrapper → Session Branch Creator → Lock Manager → Pre/Post Hooks → Workspace Selector

Safety Domain:

Exit Traps → Emergency Checkpoint → Lock Manager → Git Operations
Post-Commit Hook → Background Push → Remote Backup

Recovery Domain:

Reflog Monitor → Dangling Commit Detector → User Notification
Stash Manager → Conflict Detector → Resolution Helper


III. DECISION MATRIX
A. Use Case Classification
Type 1: AI Tool Coordination

Multiple AI coding tools (Aider, Continue, Claude Code, Copilot)
Concurrent sessions possible
Session-level work isolation required
→ Deploy: Worktree architecture, session wrappers, tool-specific branches

Type 2: Simple Bidirectional Sync

Single user editing files
No specialized tools
Simple folder synchronization
→ Deploy: Polling loop only, direct-to-main commits, skip worktrees

Type 3: Hybrid (Data + Tools)

Mix of manual edits and AI tool usage
Occasional concurrent tool use
→ Deploy: Full hybrid system with dynamic workspace selection

Type 4: Watch-Only (Ingestion)

External process drops files
No editing, only collection
→ Deploy: File watcher with minimal safety (no exit hooks needed)

B. Platform-Specific Adaptations
Windows Requirements:

PowerShell scripts for all automation
Task Scheduler for background services
Windows Credential Manager for auth
Git for Windows installed

Unix Requirements:

Bash/Zsh scripts for all automation
Cron or systemd for background services
SSH agent or credential helper for auth
Standard Git installation


IV. FILE MANIFEST

### B. Tool Session Workflow

**Invocation:**
User executes: `safe-ai-session <tool> [args]` or alias like `tool-safe claude --help`

**Sequence:**
1. **Pre-Session State Capture**
   - Current branch recorded
   - Working directory status recorded
   - Timestamp session start

2. **Session Branch Creation**
   - Generate branch name: `{tool}/{YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS}`
   - Create branch from current HEAD
   - Checkout session branch

3. **Workspace Selection**
   - Query workspace router for tool
   - If dedicated worktree exists: switch to that worktree
   - If not: remain in main workspace

4. **Pre-Session Checkpoint**
   - Stage all current changes
   - Commit with message: "checkpoint: before {tool}"
   - Push to remote

5. **Tool Execution**
   - Set environment variable AI_TOOL_NAME
   - Execute tool with pass-through arguments
   - Capture tool exit code

6. **Post-Session Checkpoint**
   - Stage all changes made by tool
   - Commit with message: "checkpoint: after {tool}"
   - Push session branch to remote with force-with-lease

7. **Session Cleanup**
   - Display session summary:
     - Branch name
     - Number of commits made
     - Files changed
     - Merge instructions
   - Log session to registry
   - Return tool exit code

**Error Handling:**
- Tool crash: Still capture post-session state
- Push failure: Retry with backoff, alert user
- Lock timeout: Alert user, display lock holder info

### C. Synchronization Workflow

**Polling Mode (Continuous):**

**Cycle Structure:**
```
[ACQUIRE LOCK]
  ↓
[UPLOAD PHASE]
  - Stage changes
  - Detect if changes exist
  - If yes: commit, push
  ↓
[DOWNLOAD PHASE]
  - Fetch with prune
  - Calculate divergence
  - If behind: pull (with stash if dirty)
  ↓
[RELEASE LOCK]
  ↓
[SLEEP INTERVAL]
  ↓
[REPEAT]
```

**Event Mode (File Watcher):**
```
[FILE CHANGE EVENT]
  ↓
[DEBOUNCE WAIT]
  ↓
[FILTER THROUGH GITIGNORE]
  ↓
[ACQUIRE LOCK]
  ↓
[UPLOAD PHASE ONLY]
  ↓
[RELEASE LOCK]
Download Flow Detail (Critical Path):

Pre-Flight Check

Verify network connectivity
Verify remote accessible
Fetch all refs with prune


Divergence Analysis

Execute: git rev-list --left-right --count HEAD...@{upstream}
Parse output: {ahead} {behind}
If ahead > 0 AND behind > 0: Non-fast-forward scenario (alert)
If behind = 0: Already up-to-date (skip)
If behind > 0: Proceed to pull


Working Directory Assessment

Execute: git diff --quiet
If exit code 0: Clean working directory
If exit code 1: Dirty working directory (uncommitted changes)


Pull Strategy Selection

If Clean:

Execute: git pull --ff-only
If fails: Non-linear history (alert, require manual merge)


If Dirty:

Create stash: git stash push -m "sync-stash {timestamp}"
Record stash ref
Execute: git pull --ff-only
Attempt: git stash pop
If pop succeeds: Done
If pop fails (conflicts):

Leave stash in place
Alert user to conflicts
Provide conflict resolution guide
User must manually resolve and drop stash






Post-Pull Verification

Verify HEAD matches upstream
Log successful sync
Update last-sync timestamp



D. Recovery Workflows
Scenario 1: Lost Work (No Branch Reference)
Detection:

User reports work missing
No current branch contains the work
May have occurred from crash or accidental reset

Recovery Process:

Run find-lost-work tool
Filter by approximate timeframe
Display dangling commits and reflog entries
User identifies correct commit by message/timestamp
Cherry-pick commit to current branch OR
Create recovery branch from that commit
Merge recovery branch to desired location

Scenario 2: Stash Conflicts
Detection:

Download flow attempted stash pop
Merge conflicts occurred
Stash remains in stack

Recovery Process:

Run stash-inspector tool
Show conflicting stash details
Show diff of stash vs current HEAD
Options:

Attempt manual merge (tool assists)
Apply stash to new branch (isolate conflicts)
Drop stash (if changes no longer needed)


User resolves conflicts in editor
Complete merge, drop stash

Scenario 3: Branch Proliferation
Detection:

Many old backup/WIP branches exist
Repository size growing
List-backups shows branches older than retention period

Recovery Process:

Run list-backups with date filter
Group branches by age tier (30d, 60d, 90d+)
For each tier:

Verify no unmerged changes
Confirm branch pushed to remote
Delete local branch
Optional: delete remote branch


Run git garbage collection


VI. TESTING SPECIFICATION
A. Unit Tests (Per Component)
Lock Manager:

Acquire lock when available: SUCCESS
Block when lock held: WAIT then SUCCESS
Timeout after configured period: FAILURE
Stale lock detection: CLEANUP then SUCCESS
Force release: IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Upload Flow:

No changes staged: SKIP commit
Changes staged: COMMIT and PUSH
Push failure: RETRY then ALERT
Lock unavailable: WAIT then PROCEED

Download Flow:

Already up-to-date: SKIP pull
Behind, clean directory: PULL success
Behind, dirty directory: STASH, PULL, POP success
Stash pop conflict: LEAVE STASH, ALERT
Non-fast-forward: ALERT, require manual

Tool Wrapper:

Pre-checkpoint creates commit: VERIFY
Session branch created: VERIFY NAME PATTERN
Tool executed with args: VERIFY PASS-THROUGH
Post-checkpoint creates commit: VERIFY
Exit code preserved: VERIFY MATCH

B. Integration Tests
Test 1: Exit Hook Activation

Open shell in repository
Make uncommitted changes
Close shell (simulate exit)
Reopen shell
Verify: WIP commit exists with timestamp
Verify: Backup branch pushed to remote

Test 2: Concurrent Tool Sessions

Start tool session A (e.g., claude)
Without finishing A, start tool session B (e.g., aider)
Verify: Both get different session branches
Verify: No lock conflicts (if worktrees) OR serialized (if shared)
Complete both sessions
Verify: Both pushed to remote with distinct branches

Test 3: Bidirectional Sync

Start sync engine in background
Make local change, verify auto-commit and push within interval
Make remote change via GitHub web UI
Verify: Local pulls within interval
Stop sync engine
Verify: Clean shutdown, lock released

Test 4: Download with Conflicts

Make local uncommitted changes
Make conflicting remote change
Trigger download flow
Verify: Stash created
Verify: Remote change pulled
Verify: Stash pop attempted and failed
Verify: User alerted to conflicts
Verify: Stash remains in stack

Test 5: Recovery from Crash

Start tool session
Simulate crash (kill -9 or task kill)
Verify: Lock eventually released (stale detection)
Verify: Work recoverable via reflog
Run find-lost-work tool
Verify: Session branch and commits visible

C. Acceptance Criteria
System is considered operational when ALL of the following are true:

Exit hook captures work on shell close (100% success rate)
Tool sessions create isolated branches (verified for all configured tools)
Sync engine runs continuously without intervention (24+ hours)
Upload flow commits and pushes local changes within configured interval
Download flow pulls remote changes without data loss
Conflicts are detected and preserved (never silently lost)
Lock manager prevents race conditions (stress tested)
GitHub Actions workflows trigger appropriately (CI runs, auto-PR works)
Recovery tools locate all dangling work (no false negatives)
All audit logs are written correctly (parseable JSON)


VII. EDGE CASES & FAILURE MODES
A. Network Failures
Scenario: Remote unreachable during push/pull
Handling:

Push/pull operations retry with exponential backoff
After N retries (configurable), enter offline mode
Offline mode: Continue local commits, queue pushes
Periodic connectivity checks
When online: Flush queued operations
Alert user if offline > threshold (e.g., 1 hour)

B. Merge Conflicts (Non-Fast-Forward)
Scenario: Local and remote diverged, can't fast-forward
Handling:

Detect via git pull --ff-only failure
DO NOT attempt automatic merge
Alert user with detailed message:

Show divergence details (commits ahead/behind)
Provide manual merge instructions
Suggest merge vs rebase decision tree


Pause synchronization until resolved
Log conflict to audit trail

C. Lock Starvation
Scenario: Lock held indefinitely, blocking all operations
Handling:

Lock timeout enforced (default: 60 seconds)
After timeout: Check lock file for PID
If PID not running: Assume crash, force release
If PID running: Alert user, show process info
Emergency force-release command available (dangerous, requires confirmation)

D. Disk Full
Scenario: No space for commits, stashes, or fetches
Handling:

All Git operations check exit codes
Detect disk full errors
Alert user immediately
Suspend operations until space available
Suggest: Cleanup old branches, run git gc

E. Worktree Corruption
Scenario: Worktree path deleted or .git link broken
Handling:

Detect on workspace selection
Alert user to corruption
Provide repair command: git worktree repair
Offer to recreate worktree from scratch
Never silently fail

F. Credential Expiry
Scenario: PAT or SSH key no longer valid
Handling:

Detect auth failures on push/pull
Distinguish from network failures
Alert user with credential refresh instructions
Provide platform-specific guidance (Credential Manager on Windows, keychain on macOS)
Pause operations until re-authenticated


VIII. OBSERVABILITY & MONITORING
A. Health Checks
Sync Engine Health:

Last successful upload timestamp
Last successful download timestamp
Number of consecutive failures
Lock acquisition latency
Queue depth (if offline mode active)

Tool Session Health:

Active sessions count
Sessions completed successfully (last 24h)
Sessions crashed (last 24h)
Average session duration by tool

Repository Health:

Uncommitted changes count
Ahead/behind commit counts
Stash count
Backup branch count
Repository size

B. Metrics Collection
File: .det-tools/metrics/current-state.json
Update Frequency: Every sync cycle
Content: Latest values for all health check metrics
File: .det-tools/metrics/timeseries.jsonl
Update Frequency: Every sync cycle
Content: Timestamped metric snapshots for trending
C. Alerting
Alert Channels:

Console output (for foreground operations)
System notifications (OS-specific: notify-send, toast)
Audit log (always)
Optional: Webhook to external monitoring (Slack, email, etc.)

Alert Conditions:

Lock held > timeout threshold
Consecutive sync failures > 3
Merge conflict detected
Disk space < threshold
Authentication failure
Stale backup branches > retention period

D. Debugging Tools
File: .det-tools/debug/trace-operation.sh (Unix) / .ps1 (Windows)
Purpose: Verbose logging for troubleshooting
Behavior:

Accept operation type (upload, download, tool-session, etc.)
Enable debug logging (set -x on Unix, Set-PSDebug on Windows)
Execute operation
Display full command trace
Output to both console and debug log file

File: .det-tools/debug/validate-state.sh (Unix) / .ps1 (Windows)
Purpose: Sanity check entire system state
Checks:

All required files exist
All scripts are executable (Unix)
Git config has required settings
Lock file not stale
No orphaned processes
Worktrees linked correctly
Remote accessible
Hooks installed and executable
Profile integration active


IX. SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
A. Credential Management
Requirements:

NEVER store plaintext credentials in files
Use platform credential managers:

Windows: Credential Manager or Windows Hello
macOS: Keychain
Linux: libsecret, gnome-keyring, or pass


Git credential helpers configured properly
SSH keys preferred over PAT when possible

File: .det-tools/security/credential-check.sh (Unix) / .ps1 (Windows)
Purpose: Verify credential storage security
Checks:

Credential helper configured
No credentials in .git/config
No credentials in scripts
Appropriate file permissions on SSH keys

B. Hook Execution Safety
Risks:

Hooks execute arbitrary code
Malicious commits could include hooks

Mitigations:

Hooks are NOT committed to repository (in .git/hooks, not tracked)
User installs hooks explicitly during setup
Hooks are reviewed before installation
Hooks use absolute paths, no PATH traversal
Hooks validate inputs before executing

C. Lock File Security
Risks:

Attacker creates lock to DoS system
Attacker modifies lock file

Mitigations:

Lock file in .git/ (not world-writable)
Lock file includes PID for validation
Stale lock detection prevents permanent locks
Lock timeout prevents indefinite blocking

D. Audit Log Integrity
Risks:

Tampering with audit logs
Logs grow unbounded

Mitigations:

Audit logs in JSONL format (append-only)
Log rotation configured (size or age based)
Archived logs compressed and timestamped
Optional: Sign audit logs with GPG


X. MAINTENANCE & OPERATIONS
A. Routine Maintenance Tasks
Daily (Automated):

Verify sync engine running
Check for stale locks
Rotate audit logs if size > threshold

Weekly (Automated):

Cleanup backup branches > retention period
Git garbage collection if repo size > threshold
Verify GitHub Actions workflows still active

Monthly (Manual):

Review audit logs for anomalies
Update dependencies (if using Python watchdog or Node chokidar)
Review and merge accumulated tool branches
Archive old session branches

B. Upgrade Process
Scenario: New version of system available
Process:

Backup current configuration
Stop sync engine and background services
Create system backup branch: system/backup/{timestamp}
Update scripts in .det-tools/
Update hooks in .git/hooks/
Migrate configuration if schema changed
Run validation tests
Restart services
Monitor for 24 hours
If stable: Remove backup branch

C. Decommissioning
Scenario: System no longer needed
Process:

Stop all background services
Remove hooks from .git/hooks/
Remove profile integrations (shell configs)
Optional: Cleanup all backup/WIP branches
Optional: Cleanup all worktrees
Remove .det-tools/ directory
Reset Git config to defaults
Archive audit logs if needed

Success Criteria: System runs 30+ days without intervention

XII. VALIDATION CHECKLIST
Before declaring system complete, verify ALL items:
Configuration

 Git config has all required settings
 .gitignore excludes all noise patterns
 Credential helper configured properly
 Upstream branch tracking set

Files & Structure

 All hook scripts exist and executable
 All wrapper scripts exist and executable
 Lock manager implemented and tested
 Sync engine scripts complete
 Recovery tools implemented
 Audit directory structure created
 Configuration file valid

Integration

 Shell profile extensions installed
 Hooks trigger correctly
 Background service runs on startup
 GitHub workflows present (if enabled)
 Worktrees created (if enabled)

Functionality

 Exit hook captures uncommitted work
 Tool wrapper creates session branches
 Upload flow commits and pushes
 Download flow pulls safely
 Lock prevents concurrent operations
 Conflicts detected and preserved
 Recovery tools find lost work
 CI loop prevention works

Testing

 All unit tests pass
 All integration tests pass
 Acceptance criteria met
 Edge cases handled gracefully
 Error messages are clear

Operations

 Metrics collected
 Audit logs written
 Health checks reportable
 Debug tools functional
 Maintenance tasks documented


XIII. AGENT IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
When materializing this blueprint:

Start with platform detection - determine Windows vs Unix early
Generate scripts in pairs - every .sh needs a .ps1 equivalent
Use absolute paths - don't rely on relative paths or PATH environment
Make operations idempotent - running setup twice should be safe
Validate before executing - check prerequisites before file creation
Provide rollback - if installation fails, clean up partial state
Echo progress - display what's being created/configured
Test incrementally - after each component, run its unit tests
Generate user documentation - create README with setup/usage instructions
Leave audit trail - log what was created/configured for debugging

Critical success factors:

Hook permissions (chmod +x on Unix)
Profile integration (user must source or restart shell)
Lock file location (must be in .git/ for atomicity)
Error handling (every operation must have failure path)
User communication (clear messages about what's happening)


END OF BLUEPRINT
This specification is complete and ready for agentic implementation. All components, interactions, workflows, and requirements are defined. An AI agent with file creation and script generation capabilities can materialize this entire system from this blueprint alone.
