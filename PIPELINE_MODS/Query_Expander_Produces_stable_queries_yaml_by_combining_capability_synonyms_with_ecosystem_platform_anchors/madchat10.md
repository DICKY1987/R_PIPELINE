Yep—there are several **well-established Python libraries** that cover the same territory as those repos (task runners, file-watching, test orchestration, subprocess/remote execution, and project templates). Here’s a tight shortlist by **purpose**, with why they’re “proven” and when to pick them:

### Task runners & automation

* **Invoke** — Pythonic tasks (`@task`) + rich subprocess control; great for local automation and composing CLI workflows. (You already looked at it.) ([Nox][1])
* **doit** — Task DAGs with **incremental/uptodate checks** and **parallel execution**; optional “auto” watch mode via plugin; good when you want Make-like smart rebuilds. ([Doit Documentation][2])
* **nox** — Define **sessions** in `noxfile.py` (e.g., lint, tests) and run them across Python versions; similar to tox but configured in Python. Great for repeatable dev tasks. ([Nox][1])
* **tox** — A long-standing **environment orchestrator** (virtualenv setup + run linters/tests/build docs, etc.); very common in CI. ([Tox][3])
* **Poe the Poet** / **taskipy** — Lightweight task runners that live in **`pyproject.toml`**; nice if you want zero extra files and easy `poe test`/`task test` UX. ([Poe the Poet][4])
* **pypyr** — YAML-defined **pipelines** (steps, variables, conditionals) run via CLI or API; good for declarative task flows. ([pypyr][5])

### File watching & continuous runs

* **watchdog** — Cross-platform filesystem events (Python API + CLI); the go-to low-level watcher. ([Python Watchdog][6])
* **watchfiles** — Modern, **fast** watcher (Rust backend); used for “run on change” workflows. ([WatchFiles][7])
* **pytest-watch / pytest-watcher** — Simple “rerun pytest on change” loop. Great for TDD. ([GitHub][8])

### Subprocess & remote execution

* **Fabric** — Remote command execution over SSH; built on Invoke’s ideas. Use when deployment/remote admin is in scope. ([FabFile][9])
* **plumbum** — Pythonic “shell combinators” for **local/remote** commands, piping, and env management. Handy if you want shell-like ergonomics in Python. ([Plumbum][10])

### Templates & “proven” project scaffolds

* **cookiecutter** — Generate projects from community-vetted templates (lots of production-ready starters). Ideal for standardizing repos. ([Cookiecutter][11])

### Pre-commit gating (to enforce the research-first step)

* **pre-commit** — Manage git hooks across languages; perfect to **gate commits** on your “research report exists” rule and to run formatters/linters. ([Pre-Commit][12])

## Quick pick guide

* **Local task CLI + rich `run()`** → *Invoke*
* **Smart, incremental builds or parallelism** → *doit*
* **Multi-env test sessions (CI-friendly)** → *nox* or *tox*
* **Keep tasks in `pyproject.toml`** → *Poe the Poet* or *taskipy*
* **Declarative YAML pipelines** → *pypyr*
* **Remote servers/SSH** → *Fabric*
* **“Run on save”** → *watchdog* / *watchfiles* (+ *pytest-watch* for tests)
* **Repo scaffolds & conventions** → *cookiecutter*
* **Enforce research gate before coding** → *pre-commit*

If you want, I can stitch a **minimal starter** that wires, say, *Poe the Poet* (tasks in `pyproject.toml`) + *watchfiles* (on-save) + *pre-commit* (research gate) + your preferred linter/test stack—so you can drop it into any repo and go.
