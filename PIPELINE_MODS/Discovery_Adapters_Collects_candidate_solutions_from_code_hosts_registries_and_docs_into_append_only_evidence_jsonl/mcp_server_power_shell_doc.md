## 1. Overview

### 1.1 What is an MCP Server?

A **Model Context Protocol (MCP) server** is a data access layer that enables AI tools (like Claude Code, Copilot, or custom GPTs) to pull accurate, structured, and authoritative information from a specific source (e.g., Microsoft Docs, GitHub, internal APIs). It acts as a bridge between your assistant and external systems—ensuring the AI is grounded in *trusted reference material* when writing or reviewing code.

### 1.2 Why Use MCP Servers in PowerShell Automation?

When developing PowerShell scripts, you want automation that can:
- Use official Microsoft documentation for syntax, parameter, and cmdlet references.
- Run automated linters and tests.
- Identify and correct errors.
- Push verified code to a repository with a pull request (PR).

MCP servers enable this by providing structured endpoints that AI clients can query for the *exact documentation*, *repository structure*, and *validation tooling* needed.

### 1.3 Core Benefits of Integration

- **Accuracy:** All code is grounded in real documentation.
- **Automation:** Enables continuous validation and self-healing loops.
- **Determinism:** Enforces predictable, rule-driven script generation.
- **Traceability:** Each AI action can cite the exact documentation source.

## 2. Microsoft Learn Docs MCP Server

### 2.1 Description and Capabilities
The **Microsoft Learn Docs MCP Server** provides programmatic access to Microsoft Learn’s structured documentation, including:
- Cmdlet syntax and parameters.
- “About_” topics (e.g., about_Functions, about_Splatting).
- Module guides and versioned content.

This ensures your AI assistant can verify syntax, parameter usage, and official examples before generating or modifying PowerShell code.

### 2.2 Cost and Usage Limits
- **Cost:** Free (Microsoft-hosted endpoint).
- **Authentication:** No login required for read access.
- **Rate Limits:** Light internal throttling (~10 QPS typical).
- **Availability:** Updated daily; mirrors Microsoft Learn.

### 2.3 Integration Steps
1. Add the server in your MCP configuration file:
   ```json
   {
     "servers": {
       "ms-learn-docs": {
         "type": "http",
         "url": "https://learn.microsoft.com/api/mcp"
       }
     }
   }
   ```
2. Configure your AI client (Claude Code, Copilot, etc.) to use this server as the *preferred grounding source* for PowerShell-related requests.
3. Test with: `Get-Help Get-Process` to verify contextual responses.

### 2.4 Role in Autonomous PowerShell Workflows
- **Planning:** Generates valid, standards-based scaffolds.
- **Validation:** Verifies syntax and structure against official docs.
- **Education:** Provides inline learning material within your terminal or editor.

### 2.5 Example Configuration
In `mcp.json`:
```json
{
  "servers": {
    "ms-learn-docs": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://learn.microsoft.com/api/mcp"
    }
  },
  "instructions": [
    "Always validate PowerShell syntax using Microsoft Learn documentation before writing or fixing code."
  ]
}
```

## 3. PowerShell AI Shell MCP Host

### 3.1 Description and Purpose
The **AI Shell MCP Host** is an interactive PowerShell environment that enables your assistant to:
- Observe real terminal output.
- Execute PowerShell commands directly.
- Call MCP servers (like Learn Docs or GitHub).

This allows fully automated “write → lint → fix → verify” loops in a local PowerShell session.

### 3.2 Cost and Usage Limits
- **Tool Cost:** Free (Microsoft open preview).
- **Model Cost:** Pay per API if using external LLMs (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.).
- **Limits:** Local-only; no rate limits except model API quota.

### 3.3 Integration Steps
1. Install AI Shell:
   ```bash
   dotnet tool install -g Microsoft.AIShell
   ```
2. Create a configuration file at `%USERPROFILE%\.aish\mcp.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "servers": {
       "ms-learn-docs": { "type": "http", "url": "https://learn.microsoft.com/api/mcp" }
     }
   }
   ```
3. Launch AI Shell and run `/mcp list` to verify server registration.

### 3.4 Workflow Automation and Error Correction
AI Shell can:
- Run **PSScriptAnalyzer** and interpret its JSON output.
- Execute **Pester tests** for validation.
- Automatically modify scripts and rerun checks until all tests pass.

This creates a self-healing automation loop.

### 3.5 Example Configuration
```json
{
  "servers": {
    "ms-learn-docs": { "type": "http", "url": "https://learn.microsoft.com/api/mcp" }
  },
  "tools": {
    "run_command_in_terminal": true
  }
}
```

## 4. GitHub MCP Server

### 4.1 Description and Capabilities
The **GitHub MCP Server** enables your AI assistant to:
- Clone, read, and write files in repositories.
- Create and manage branches.
- Open Pull Requests (PRs).
- Interact with GitHub Actions for CI/CD.

### 4.2 Cost and Usage Limits
- **Cost:** Free for public usage; API rate limits apply (5,000 GraphQL points/hour/user typical).
- **Auth:** OAuth 2.1 or Personal Access Token (PAT).
- **Limits:** Tied to GitHub’s REST and GraphQL quotas.

### 4.3 Integration Steps
1. Add the server to your configuration:
   ```json
   {
     "servers": {
       "github": {
         "type": "http",
         "url": "https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/"
       }
     }
   }
   ```
2. Authenticate using OAuth or a GitHub PAT.
3. Test with `list_repos` or `open_pull_request` tool.

### 4.4 Workflow Automation and Continuous Validation
- **Continuous Integration:** Runs GitHub Actions after code submission.
- **Continuous Validation:** Collects test results via the MCP server.
- **Traceability:** Each commit can include references to Learn Docs.

### 4.5 Example Configuration
```json
{
  "servers": {
    "github": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/"
    }
  },
  "instructions": [
    "After successful validation, commit code changes, push a new branch, and open a PR for review."
  ]
}
```

## 5. Autonomous Workflow Architecture

### 5.1 Stage 1: Authoring (Guided Generation)
- AI uses Microsoft Learn Docs MCP to generate correct syntax and structure.
- PowerShell AI Shell provides local context (e.g., `$PSVersionTable`).

### 5.2 Stage 2: Static Analysis (Linting and Rule Enforcement)
- AI triggers `Invoke-ScriptAnalyzer` via AI Shell.
- Errors are parsed, categorized, and automatically corrected.

### 5.3 Stage 3: Testing (Functional Verification)
- Tests executed using `Invoke-Pester`.
- Output analyzed for logic or assertion errors.

### 5.4 Stage 4: Self-Healing (Automated Fixing)
- AI re-runs failing steps until all checks succeed.
- Detected issues can auto-trigger documentation lookups.

### 5.5 Stage 5: Deployment and PR Automation
- GitHub MCP commits changes, pushes branch, and opens a PR.
- CI runs in GitHub Actions; MCP can fetch logs and status.

## 6. Security, Cost, and Reliability Considerations

### 6.1 OAuth vs. Personal Access Tokens (PAT)
- Prefer **OAuth** for automatic expiry and limited scopes.
- Use PATs only in local or air-gapped workflows.

### 6.2 Rate Limiting and Quota Management
- Batch requests and use caching where possible.
- Respect MCP server guidance to avoid throttling.

### 6.3 Safe Sandbox Practices
- Run automated code only in non-production environments.
- Log every MCP transaction with timestamp and tool ID.
